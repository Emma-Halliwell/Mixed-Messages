# Mixed-Messages

Mixed messages is a Codecademy project. This is where I put my knowledge of JavaScript, HTML and CSS to the test. 

## Project Description

This application is to produce a random message. My random message consists of a Zodiac sign (horoscope sign), a random ruler for the Zodiac sign, and a random positive message. 

Within this project the only specification was to use JavaScript. I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I used JavaScript in order to randomize all elements of the project. I then used HTML and CSS in order to provide a way to interact with application if they don't have access to a JavaScript runtime environment. 

The biggest challenge that I encountered, was using the correct objects, functions, and variables. I would second guess whether I was using the correct object for each different element. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but could be detrimental in the future when working to a tight deadline. I can improve this by working with JavaScript more, in order to get comfortable in picking the correct object to use. Along with encountering different ways in which to code each element to give the same functionality.

I plan on implementing arrow functions in the future. This is due to arrow functions being a slim line way of writing functions.

## How to use

### Git and GitHub

Git is used to navigate through a directory. A directory is a filing system for all the related content to a project. Git can be installed by visiting https://gitforwindows.org/ and the clicking on the download button.

GitHub is an online cloud storage system. This is where the project is saved and can be accessed later. The main branch is where the working code is stored. If you want to make changes is best to create another branch. This is so the application can be working while you are making changes. The new branch can merge with the main branch after it has been approved. 

In order to access GitHub will need to create an account or sign in to your account. You can then clone the repository that you would like access. Once cloned you will be able to run the application. This application was written in Visual Studio Code. If you do not have Visual Studio Code, the next section will provide information on how to install Visual Studio Code. 

### Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is a code editing software. This application was made and edited in Visual Studio Code version 1.79. Visual Studio Code can access all the document written in each of the coding languages. 

To install Visual Studio Code visit https://code.visualstudio.com/Download. Then click on your operating system to download the latest version. 

Once you have installed, press ctrl - shift - p. This will open command palette. In the command palette type clone. Click on Git: Clone and paste the URL for the repository that you want to access. You will then be prompted to save the repository to your local computer. You will then have access to the files within the repository. 

In order to run the code, make sure that you have the Live Server installed. You can check this by clicking on the extension tab at the bottom of the sidebar on the left. 

If installed you can open the Live server by right clicking on the index.html file and clicking open live server. 

However, if you do not have a Live server extension, follow these directions: 

1. Search live server and install live server by Ritwick Dey. 
2. Then navigate to Google Chrome. 
3. Once Google Chrome is open navigate to the top left hand corner and click on the three dots. 
4. Once you have clicked on the three dots click on extensions. 
5. Once the extension page is loaded search extensions for Live Server Web Extension. The same logo will appear for Ritwick Dey. 
6. Then you can navigate back to Visual Studio Code.
7. Right click on index.html and click on open with live server.
